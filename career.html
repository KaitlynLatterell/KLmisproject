                <p> Position: RN Supervisor Case Management</p>
                <p>Since I am only a freshman, I do not have enough experience to actually get an internship yet; however, if I look at this as if it were after I completed the necessary credits, I believe this is a great option for me. When I spoke to the representatives, they told me that I could start as an intern for the company, then finish my degree, and come back with a higher position within the company. In this role, I would be assisting Medical Management leadership and working together to support Medical Management teams. When the time comes for me to apply for the internship, I believe I will be well-qualified and prepared to suit the role.

                <h2>Brown & Brown</h2>
                <p>Position: Account Manager - Healthcare</p>
                <p>To start, I am majoring in Health Care Management, so this position is exactly what I am looking to do with my degree. When I spoke to the Brown & Brown representative, she explained that this role would consist of managing clients’ health insurance accounts. This would be an amazing internship opportunity for me because when it is time for me to apply next September, I will have the right education, and I could use it for an internship credit for my degree. She also explained to me that often they will keep you on part-time even when the internship is over, so that you can come back and go into a career there.</p>
