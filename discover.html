                <h2>Why I Chose Duluth</h2>
                <p>I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth not only for its perfect location and size, but also 
                    for the opportunities I will gain from earning my degree here. 
                    I know that I will be able to succeed in my career because UMD cares 
                    about its students and has many sources you can go to for help with 
                    internships, academics, and placements. The university’s strong network of 
                    alumni and partnerships with leading organizations will open doors to 
                    experiences I might not have elsewhere. In addition, UMD’s diverse campus 
                    community will allow me to learn from people with different perspectives,
                    which will prepare me to thrive in a wide range of environments. I love 
                    everything outdoors, and the ability to drive for a few minutes to be somewhere I can hike 
                     is one of my favorite things about living here. 
                    You truly do get a big city feel with the community of a small town, 
                    which makes UMD stand out as the perfect balance between opportunity and 
                    comfort.
