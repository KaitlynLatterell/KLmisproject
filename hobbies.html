                    <h2>Markets</h2>
                    <p> Whether it is a flea, farmers', fall, or Christmas market, visiting markets is one of my favorite weekend activities. I love exploring local produce,
                    handmade goods, and enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. It's a great way to support local farmers and artisans
                    while discovering fresh, fun, and new ingredients for my cooking. Being able to interact with vendors and learn about their products adds a personal touch to the experience.</p>

                    <h2>Outdoors</h2>
                    <p>Exploring the outdoors allows me to connect with nature
                        and find peace away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
                        Whether it's fishing, hiking, or simply enjoying a walk in the park,
                        I cherish the beauty of the natural world and the tranquility it brings. I love boat rides, and spending my days outside both in the summer and winter.</p>

                    <h2>Hiking</h2>
                    <p>Hiking allows me to immerse myself in nature and experience
                     the great outdoors. I love exploring new trails, 
                     breathing in the fresh air, and enjoying the stunning
                     views from the top. It's a fantastic way to stay active
                     and connect with the natural world. I love the reward that comes at the end of each hike: a breathtaking view that makes the effort worthwhile. Some of my faovrite places to hike so far have been Duluth, MN, Winona, MN, and Arenal, CR.</p>
